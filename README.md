# 🖐️ AI Deaf Connect – Hand Gesture Recognition (Phase 1)

An AI-powered hand gesture recognition application built using **Python**, **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**.

The application captures live video from a webcam, detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe, predicts gestures using a trained **Random Forest Machine Learning model**, and converts the detected gesture into speech.

This project is the **Phase 1 Proof of Concept (POC)** for the **AI Deaf Connect** project, whose long-term goal is to enable seamless communication between hearing and hearing-impaired individuals.

# 📊 Dataset

The dataset is generated using MediaPipe hand landmarks.

Each sample contains:

* Gesture Label
* 21 Hand Landmarks
* X Coordinate
* Y Coordinate
* Z Coordinate

Total Features:

```
21 Landmarks × 3 Coordinates = 63 Features
```

Example:

```text
label,x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1,...,x20,y20,z20

ONE,...

TWO,...

FIVE,...
```

Approximately **300 samples** were collected for each gesture.

# 🔊 Text To Speech

Detected gestures are automatically converted into speech.

Example:

```
Gesture

↓

FIVE

↓

Audio

↓

"Five"
```

Speech is generated only when the gesture changes to avoid repeated playback.
